## Imaging Technique Inspiration

Our group selected Piet Mondrian's "Broadway Boogie Woogie," a piece heavily influenced by New York's Broadway and the rhythmic style of Boogie-Woogie music.

 Although the painting initially aims to capture the leisurely essence of New York life, it evoked in me the mechanized rhythm of Charlie Chaplinâ€™s assembly line from "Modern Times." [Modern Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT-mVVprnbs) Inspired by this connection, I plan to incorporate the concept of an assembly line into the interpretation of the artwork.

 In my vision, the yellow lines serve as conveyor belts, while the various colored squares represent goods moving along these belts. This dynamic portrayal intends to reflect the relentless movement and the dehumanizing aspect of industrialization, inviting deeper contemplation on its impacts.

## Coding Technique Exploration

To achieve this effect, it is necessary to randomly generate red, white, and blue blocks, and control the distance between the blocks to ensure overall aesthetics.
Set up an animation to make the blocks seem to move on the assembly line. By adjusting the position parameters and movement speed of the blocks, a real pipeline environment can be simulated.
Here is an example of using p5.js, which shows how to create and dynamically control objects. Use it for pipeline block animation projects, which can move blocks on the pipeline
